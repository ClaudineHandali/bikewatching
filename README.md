# bikewatching

# This project demonstrates how to combine D3 and Mapbox to visualize real-world bike-sharing data. By calculating station-level arrivals, departures, and total traffic, we map stations as circles whose sizes reflect traffic volume, add interactive tooltips, and enable time-based filtering to explore patterns throughout the day.
